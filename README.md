# R_Animation
Creating a short animation using R Markdown files saved with .rmd extension.


To create an R markdown file the first step involves going to the file option -> new file -> R markdown.

You can either copy the code or directly run the R file attached to the repository.

Further, you must have an account on RPub publishing repository.

In the markdown file, click on Knit option and then publish in whatever format desirable, save it and publish.
